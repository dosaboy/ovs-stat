version: '1.0'
summary: Tool to create a sysfs-style representation of an Openvswitch switch.
description:
    Analysing Openvswitch flow tables can be hard. This tool organises information from
    an Openvswitch switch such as flows and ports into a filesystem structure so that
    conventional tools like find, ls and grep can be used to perform queries and provide
    a more intuitive visualisation of the configuration of an ovs switch.
